**HTML Forms**
An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.

**The <form> Element**
The HTML <form> element is used to create an HTML form for user input:
The <form> element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.
  
**<input> types**
How an <input> works varies considerably depending on the value of its type attribute, hence the different types are covered in their own separate reference pages. If this attribute is not specified, the default type adopted is text.
The available types are as follows:

**button: **
A push button with no default behavior displaying the value of the value attribute, empty by default.

**checkbox: **
A check box allowing single values to be selected/deselected.
  
**color: **
A control for specifying a color; opening a color picker when active in supporting browsers.

A control for entering a date (year, month, and day, with no time). Opens a date picker or numeric wheels for year, month, day when active in supporting browsers.
  
**datetime-local: **
A control for entering a date and time, with no time zone. Opens a date picker or numeric wheels for date- and time-components when active in supporting browsers.	
  
**email: **
A field for editing an email address. Looks like a text input, but has validation parameters and relevant keyboard in supporting browsers and devices with dynamic keyboards.

A control that lets the user select a file. Use the accept attribute to define the types of files that the control can select.
